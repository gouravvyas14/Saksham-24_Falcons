Certainly! Here’s a human-readable summary of the topics covered in today’s session about showcasing our projects:

### Missing Values
When dealing with missing data in our datasets, we discussed:
- Using the mode, median, or standard deviation to fill missing values.
- Strategies for handling categorical data, ensuring it doesn’t affect our analysis.

### Outlier Detection
Identifying outliers in our data to prevent them from skewing our results.

### Feature Scaling
Normalizing data to a range of (-1, 1) or (0, 1) to ensure all features contribute equally.

### Feature Construction
Creating new features from existing ones, like grouping individuals based on family size.

### Feature Selection
Choosing the most relevant features to include in our analysis to improve model accuracy.

### Feature Extraction
Extracting key information from raw data, such as converting home features like rooms and amenities into usable metrics.

### Feature Engineering
Enhancing the quality of data by creating new features, like analyzing car attributes to predict pricing.

In our project on predicting home prices, we aim to utilize these techniques effectively for accurate results. Each step contributes to a clearer understanding of our data and improves the performance of our predictive models.
